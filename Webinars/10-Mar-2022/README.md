A webinar on the use of identifiers within DCAT-AP took place on the 10th of March 2022.

One of the most important data processing steps of data catalogues is  harvesting. City data portals are being harvested by national data portals, which in turn are harvested by the European Data Portal. This results that the same dataset description is present on multiple data portals. In this webinar we take a closer look at one key information element: the identifier of a dataset or data service. The value of this information has been acknowledged by the community, but because not everyone is approaching it in similar way, aggregating data portals have difficulties to conduct tasks like detecting duplicates.

The agenda for this webinar is the following:

    Welcome
    A state of play on identifiers
    Exchange of ideas on guidelines for identifiers and harvesting processes to improve the knowledge graph on datasets and data services
