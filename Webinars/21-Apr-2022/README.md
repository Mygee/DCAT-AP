A second webinar on the use of identifiers within DCAT-AP took place on the 21th of April 2022.


One of the most important data processing steps of data catalogues is harvesting. Harvesting is the aggregation of source catalogues into a one catalogue with the objective to increase the visibility of the datasets of the sources. Within the Public Sector Information context, a common example is the harvesting of city data portals by national data portals, which in turn are harvested by the European Data Portal. In practice harvesting interconnects catalogues with different size, scope and perspectives into a complex network. 

Harvesting has as result that the same dataset description is present on multiple data portals. In this webinar we take a closer look at one key information element:  the identifier of a dataset or data service. The value of this information has been acknowledged by the community, but because not everyone is approaching it in a similar way, aggregating data portals have difficulties to conduct tasks like detecting duplicates. 

The first webinar took place on the 10th of March, where the working group chose to proceed along the blue track, which implies that the value is assigned by the owner/publisher of the dataset. The decisions made during the first webinar will be added to Github. The materials of the first webinar are available on Joinup.  

In this second webinar we continue our exchange on ideas on this basis to reach consensus on the guidelines on the usage of identifiers. 

The tentative agenda for this webinar is the following: 

-    Welcome 
-   Propose a consolidated overview of the blue track guidelines 
-    Exchange of ideas on those guidelines to improve the knowledge graph on datasets and data services 
-    Next steps 
-    AOB
